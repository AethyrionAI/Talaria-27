# Device pass — running list

**A living list, not a dated pass.** Items are added as they are found and struck
when a verdict is recorded. Unlike `OPUS-T27-DEVICE-PASS-2026-07-25.md` this is
never "finished" — it is the queue that fills up between sittings.

**Started 2026-08-01.** Owen drives the phone; Claude reads logs and records
verdicts.

## How to use this

- **Record PASS / FAIL / PARTIAL / UNRUNNABLE.** PARTIAL and UNRUNNABLE are real
  outcomes. Do not round a partial up.
- **If a check cannot be performed as written, that is a defect in THIS
  DOCUMENT.** Say so and move on; never improvise a substitute check and record
  its result as a pass. (Carried from the 07-25 pass, where it earned its place.)
- **Log reads:** the app's own `Logger(subsystem:)` lines are NOT reachable from
  `idevicesyslog` — that is unified logging and the Mac CLI cannot see it (#133,
  proven on hardware). Use the Xcode bridge's `GetConsoleOutput`, and filter with
  `oslogSeverity: ["default"]` — its `pattern:` argument silently returns zero
  units for text that IS present. `scripts/device-pass-capture.sh` covers system
  processes only (`chronod`, `AppIntents`, `runningboardd`).
- **Verbose diagnostics** live behind the Developer screen's `verboseLogging`
  toggle. Several checks below need it ON.
- **Battery runs:** foreground and on power. Backgrounding the phone kills a run.

## A · #198 — the last open question, and the only user-facing risk here

### A1 · Real interruption, both engines · **[OWEN + PHONE, CLAUDE READS LOG]**

**This is the highest-value item on the list.** The 2026-08-01 pass proved there
are no false POSITIVES — three app deactivations were correctly filtered, zero
spurious "Audio interrupted." It proves nothing about false NEGATIVES, and the
two are not symmetric:

- an unwarranted `.interrupted` **self-recovers** via the route-change handler
- a **missed** interruption leaves a **dead capture chain that still looks
  alive** — the UI says listening, the mic is gone

**DO:** start a live voice session, then have someone call the phone. Repeat for
**both** engines (`LiveVoiceSessionService` and `NativeVoicePipelineService` —
the Talk screen's engine selector).

- **PASS:** the session reports interrupted, and after declining/ending the call
  it resumes or ends cleanly — no state where the UI claims to be listening and
  nothing is captured.
- **FAIL:** UI still says listening after the call; speech produces nothing.

**Claude captures:** `didBecomeInactive` with `source == .system` (verbose ON),
and whether `AudioInterruptionRule.isInterruption` returned true. Also
`resumptionRecommendationNotification` and its `.shouldResume` value on call end.

**Closes:** #198's last open question, plus open questions A and B.

### A2 · `BGTaskScheduler` app-refresh actually fires · **[OWEN + PHONE]**

The migrated `submitTaskRequest` completion path has **never run** — the
2026-08-01 pass never backgrounded the app.

**DO:** background the app and leave it. Overnight is fine; the system decides
when `BGAppRefreshTask` runs.

- **PASS:** an `app-refresh scheduled (earliest +15m)` line, and later evidence
  the refresh executed.
- **FAIL:** a `submit failed:` line, or no scheduling line at all.

**Note the asymmetry that motivated the migration:** the old throwing `submit`
UNDER-reported ("to capture all error conditions" is Apple's own deprecation
reason), so a submit that didn't throw was never proof it landed. This check is
the first time we see the real answer.

## B · #130 — the half-duplex A/B, owed since 2026-07-20

### B1 · Half-duplex gate vs talk-over barge-in · **[OWEN — SUBJECTIVE VERDICT]**

Branch `probe/t27-130-halfduplex` (on origin **and** local; DO NOT DELETE — #130
is open). It is `.default` session mode, no `setVoiceProcessingEnabled`, and a
software gate discarding recognition while TTS `isSpeaking` + 300ms hangover.

**DO:** build the probe branch to the phone, hold a voice conversation, compare
against `main`.

- **The trade being judged:** crisper TTS (no ducking) vs losing the ability to
  barge in while the assistant speaks. **This is Owen's call — it is a
  preference, not a measurement**, which is exactly why it has sat this long.

**Weight:** #105/#141 note that the realtime engine may need the identical gate
at its transcription ingest, so this verdict now decides two engines, not one.

---

## C · Measurement items — cheap to fold into any sitting

### C1 · `searchPlaces` n=20
Never run at n=20. Foreground, on power.

### C2 · #206's row set
Outstanding from the #206 lane.

### C3 · #212 `readLocation` dropped-country delta
The MapKit migration (`CLGeocoder` → `MKReverseGeocodingRequest`) changed which
fields come back; the `country` delta is disclosed in the tracker but not
measured on device.

### C4 · Matched-thermal replication of OPEN_ITEMS #215 / #216
**These are the measurement items, NOT the PR numbers** — the sequences differ.
Both verdicts carried a stated thermal confound running AGAINST the winner, so a
matched-thermal re-run would strengthen conclusions that are currently honest but
qualified. Long; only worth a dedicated sitting.

## D · Spotted, never chased

### D1 · Cold-route timeouts at launch
`:8765/models` and `:8000/v1/commands` timed out at launch while push/register to
the **same relay** succeeded four seconds later. Reads like a cold Tailscale
route rather than a service being down. **Not diagnosed.** Worth one deliberate
cold launch with verbose on.

### D2 · LAN-hosted backends are ATS-blocked · **[DECISION FIRST, THEN TEST]**
`http://192.168.x` and MagicDNS names have **no** ATS exception — only the
Tailscale CGNAT range `100.64.0.0/10` does. This explains the
`listSessions: 'Mac Mini' unreachable` line seen on 2026-08-01.

**Owen decides whether LAN backends should work at all.** If yes, it needs its
own measured arm in #166b's harness (probes inside the app test host, so
`URLSession` obeys the real plist — `curl` does not exercise ATS). Note
`NSAllowsLocalNetworking` was tested only against a **CGNAT** host and has never
been tried against a `192.168.x` one. **That is the untried arm** — do not assume
the key does what its name suggests, because for CGNAT it did not.

---

## E · Probes that are deliberately NOT tests

### E1 · `installTap` double-install · **[ISOLATED BUILD, NOT THE SUITE]**
Does the migrated `AudioNodeTap.install` THROW on a double-install where the old
API raised an uncatchable ObjC exception?

**Deliberately not written as a test:** if the successor still raises, it takes
down the test host rather than failing, which would cost a green suite and teach
nothing. Wants a throwaway build with one deliberate double-install.

**Until it runs, the migration's rationale is well-founded INFERENCE and is
labelled as such in #198.** The preflights (#82's format check, #128's `removeTap`
adjacency) prevent the failure; this probe only prices the residue.
